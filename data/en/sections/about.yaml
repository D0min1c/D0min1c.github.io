# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate cloud infrastructure engineer with 3 years of hands-on experience.
As an AWS Customer Support Engineer at Megazone Cloud, for about two years, I have been actively solving clients cloud-based issues and run their businesses smoothly.

But now I work for a game company.
The main tasks are to operate the entire Cloud (AWS, GCP) infrastructure of the game, deploy directly through the Terraform module, and manage resource monitoring through Prometheus and Grafana.
